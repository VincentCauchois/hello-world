# hello-world
First repository - Discovering GitHub - Hi World !

I am a 23 year-old student in Engineering at ISAE-Supa√©ro.

I wish to become a research engineer in the field of biodiversity functional ecology studies, with a technical specialization in satellite data analysis and treatment.

I have been learning computer science and programming ; in Python, Matlab, and OCaml, and a bit of Java and C ; for a little over 5 years now.
I want to get to know more :
- Python ; machine learning, data analysis, NLP, image treatment ; 
- Javascript
- R
- SQL

Here on GitHub to start my first projects and expand my vision on new computing problems and collaborative works.
